At 1.5 V, a Cr-N film could be also obtained, but its growth rate was relatively low. The film prepared at 1.5 V consisted of two distinctive layers. The surface layer was amorphous Cr-N containing crystalline CrN particles, and the inner layer was crystalline CrN.

Usually made of graphite, this component is studied worldwide in order to develop a commercially viable alternative: different ways have been being investigated, and to date, despite corrosion issues, stainless steel (SS) appears as a good candidate material, but its Electrical Contact Resistance (ECR) can reach unacceptable values when exposed to PEFC environment. This paper offers a comprehensive study of the parameters acting on ECR when using uncoated SS in PEFC: roughness, which influences the surface contact area with carbon baking, bulk composition of the alloy, which influences only partly the nature of passive films, and the composition and structure of passive films, strongly modified by surface treatments and ageing conditions. \copyright{} 2009 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.},

Bipolar plates are the key components of these devices as they account for significant fractions of their weight and cost. Metallic materials have advantages over graphite-based ones because of their higher mechanical strength and better electrical conductivity. However, corrosion resistance is a major concern that remains to be solved as metals may develop oxide layers that increase electrical resistivity, thus lowering the fuel cell efficiency. This paper aims to present the main results found in recent literature about the corrosion performance of metallic bipolar plates. ?? 2010 Professor T. Nejat Veziroglu.},

Using only short periods (2 seconds) of helox or pure O2 operation, the disturbing artifacts (dry out or change of catalyst surface oxidation state) associated with continuous operation with these gases were avoided. High resolution neutron imaging was conducted simultaneously in order to study the relation between mass transport loss and liquid water accumulation. For the studied design, comparisons in steady state and dynamic experiments indicated a larger impact of water accumulation in the gas diffusion layers (GDL) under the flow channels, or in the portion of the channels near the GDL surface. Increased diffusion losses were observed, as expected, under high humidity conditions, but also at very low humidity conditions in absence of any liquid water. The latter was explained by a redistribution of current toward the rib region, having longer diffusion paths.},

This paper presents results of scale-up studies to determine the feasibility of extending the nitridation approach to thin 0.1 mm stainless steel alloy foils for proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) bipolar plates. Developmental Fe-20Cr-4V alloy and type 2205 stainless steel foils were treated by pre-oxidation and nitridation to form low-ICR, corrosion-resistant surfaces. As-treated Fe-20Cr-4V foil exhibited target (low) ICR values, whereas 2205 foil suffered from run-to-run variation in ICR values, ranging up to 2\texttimes{} the target value. Pre-oxidized and nitrided surface structure examination revealed surface-through-layer-thickness V-nitride particles for the treated Fe-20Cr-4V, but near continuous chromia for treated 2205 stainless steel, which was linked to the variation in ICR values. Promising corrosion resistance was observed under simulated aggressive PEMFC anode- and cathode-side bipolar plate conditions for both materials, although ICR values were observed to increase. The implications of these findings for stamped bipolar plate foils are discussed. \copyright{} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

X-ray diffraction spectra revealed that Cr2O3 diffraction peaks appeared above 650????C and the relative integrated intensity of the oxide increased gradually with temperatures. Moreover, five vibration bands associated with Cr2O3 were discerned in Raman spectra above this temperature. Nano-granular structure showed up at 650????C, while abnormal grain growth resulting from the grain coalescence occurred above 800????C. A thin dense oxide overlayer was present at 650????C and the oxide thickness increased gradually with temperatures. Meanwhile, underneath CrN grains grew drastically above 700????C and became more equiaxially-grained at 850????C. The pre-exponential factor and activation energy of oxidation for CrN films were evaluated by analyzing the Arrhenius relation from the temperature dependence of oxide thickness. The obtained values were 1.3 ?? 10- 8??cm2/s and 110 ?? 6??kJ/mol, respectively, which is comparable to the literature data. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Multilayers constituted three separate layers of CrN with intermediate interlayers of Cr (0.1 {$\mu$}m). The total coating thickness was in the range 4.5-5.5 {$\mu$}m. Under galvanostatic conditions, anodic oxidation of CrN leads to replacement of nitrogen in the CrN coating by oxygen, forming oxy-nitrides on the samples surface.

The results show that the anodic overpotentials cannot be ignored, even when the operating conditions are changed at the cathode only. Under drying conditions the difference in the current density across the active area creates in-plane thermal gradients due to inhomogeneous reaction rates, and water phase changes. The resulting inhomogeneous temperature distributions can result in membrane and electrode degradation. The combination of reference electrodes and multi-component gas analysis enables the measurement and calculation of kinetic and diffusion parameters that can be used for modeling, and improved fuel cell design, efficiency, and durability.

It was observed that the OCV decreased with increasing temperature. Analysis of the partial O2 and H2 pressures in the feed streams revealed that the decrease in partial pressures with temperature were largely responsible for the decrease in OCV. The difference between the theoretical and measured OCVs was analyzed based on the literature, calculations, and hydrogen crossover measurements at OCV. It was concluded that the difference in OCV is caused mainly by two factors, one is the mixed potential of the Pt/PtO catalyst surface, and the other is hydrogen crossover. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

An austenitic stainless steel (ASS) is modified with W and La to improve the stability of the passive film in an acidic environment as well as to reduce the contact resistance by the tungsten bronze effect. The experimental ASS containing W and La was evaluated in a simulated PEMFC environment of H3PO4 and H2SO4 solutions at 80 ??C, and the electrical property was evaluated by performing a contact resistance test. The test results show that the ASS modified with W and La has good passive film stability for corrosion resistance and low contact resistance. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis clearly suggests the possibility of the tungsten bronze effect from the change in valency state of W6+ to W5+ in the passive film formed on the modified ASS. The feasibility of a new alloy design concept utilizing the 'tungsten bronze effect' is well demonstrated; however, more study is highly required for the development of metallic bipolar plates of PEMFC. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In order to easily understand how to control the surface roughness of 304SS in the glycerol-containing electrolyte, a simplified scheme integrating the above two mechanisms was proposed.

The mixture model was used to simulate two phases for the purpose of examining flow features in the flow field plate in order to effectively guide the design of electrolysis cells. The water flow rate was maintained as a constant of 260 mL/min, while the flow rate of oxygen generation was assumed to change from 0 to 14 mg/s. The obtained results including the velocity, pressure, and volume fraction distributions are presented and discussed. It is found that the obtained results for single-phase flow cases cannot be linearly extrapolated into the two-phase flow cases. The irregular velocity profile (locally low velocity magnitude near the exit port section) is not observed when the flow rate of oxygen generation is relatively low. As the mass flow rate of oxygen generation increases, reverse flow develops inside the flow channels. \copyright{} 2010 Professor T. Nejat Veziroglu.},

The characterisation of the composition and structure of such thin films and the study of their interaction with corrosive environments requires a combination of sophisticated experimental techniques. This paper reviews progress in the characterisation and understanding of passive films on stainless steels achieved over the past two decades. During this period, ex situ surface analysis methods have made substantial progress and new in situ methods for the study of passive films with atomic resolution have been introduced, giving real time information on film chemistry and growth. It has been found that whereas passive film growth occurs in seconds or minutes, long range film ordering is a considerably slower process that takes several hours. In situ investigations indicate that at short times, charge transfer at the metal/film or the film/solution interface limits the rate of film growth on stainless steels. In situ estimates of film composition confirm previous data obtained with ex situ techniques. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {Solar energy is the most abundant source of renewable energy. The direct method of harnessing solar energy is the solar thermal conversion method using solar absorbers. The absorbers are coated with solar selective coatings with high absorptance and low thermal emittance. Spectrally selective coatings which are stable up to temperatures {$\leq$}300{$^\circ$}C (in air and vacuum) have been developed in the past. These coatings are mainly deposited from wet chemical routes (e.g., electrodeposition) and have been reviewed widely in the literature. Because of the environmental issues as well as low thermal stability of these wet chemical deposited coatings, researchers all over the world started looking for other alternative routes such as physical vapor deposited (PVD) coatings. A great deal of research has been carried out since 1990s to develop PVD coatings for both mid- and high-temperature applications. The mid-temperature coatings are used mainly for solar hot water and industrial process heat applications, whereas, the high-temperature absorber coatings are used in concentrating solar power systems for solar thermal power generation. It is well recognized that in order to increase the efficiency of solar thermal power plants, solar selective coatings with high thermal stability are required. In recent years, significant efforts have been made in the field of solar selective coatings to achieve high solar absorptance and low thermal emittance at higher temperatures (T{$\geq$}400{$^\circ$}C). Transition metal based cermets have emerged as novel high temperature solar selective coatings, which are currently being used for solar thermal power plants for electricity generation. Solar selective coatings based on transition metal nitrides, oxides and oxynitrides also hold great potential for high-temperature applications because of their excellent mechanical and optical properties, which are yet to be commercialized. In this review, we present the state-of-the-art of the physical vapor deposited solar selective coatings used for solar thermal applications with an emphasis on sputter deposited coatings for high-temperature applications. A detailed survey, covering the period 1970-present, has been made for the PVD deposited solar selective coatings with high absorptance and low emittance. This review article also describes in detail about the commercially available PVD coatings for flat-plate/evacuated tube collectors and solar thermal power generation applications. \copyright{} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {The present study aims at obtaining a better understanding on the changes that the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) of a H 2-fed fuel cell experiences along an activation procedure. An activation protocol was set-up considering six loading cycles performed at 25??C. After each loading cycle, the electrochemical characterization was performed using polarization curves, Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV), Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS). Polarization curves showed an effective increase of the MEA performance along the activation procedure, with the maximum power density increasing from 116.1 mW cm -2 to 229.9 mW cm -2 and the overall efficiency increasing from 9.3\% to 19.7\%. Simultaneously, it was observed a decrease on the Tafel slope and an increase on the exchange current density, indicating improved catalyst characteristics. From the LSV experiments it was concluded that hydrogen crossover at open circuit increases along the activation procedure, however the open circuit voltage (OCV) also increases, mainly due to an overvoltage decrease caused by mixed potential. CV experiments showed that the available catalyst area also increases. From the impedance experiments it was observed that the proton exchange membrane (PEM) and the anode and cathode charge transfer resistances decrease along the activation cycles. The opposite trend was verified for the anode and cathode double layer capacitances. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract     = {The impacts of unprotected start up and shut down on fuel cell performance degradation was investigated using both single cell and dual cell configurations. It was found that the air/fuel boundary developed at the anode side after a fuel cell shut down or during its restart caused extremely quick degradation of the cathode. The thickness, the electrochemical active surface area, and the performance of the cathode catalyst layer were significantly reduced. By using a dual cell configuration, cathode potential as high as two times of open circuit voltage was measured, and the corrosion current flowing externally between the two cells was detected and quantified. Carbon catalyst-support corrosion/oxidation at such a high potential was largely responsible for the accelerated fuel cell performance degradation. \copyright{} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {The polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) based fuel cells are clean alternative energy systems that hold excellent potential for cost effectiveness, durability, and relatively high overall efficiency. PEM fuel cell is recognized by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) as the main candidate to replace the internal combustion engine in transportation applications. Metallic bipolar plates and membrane electrode assembly (MEA) are two crucial components of a PEM power stack and their durability and fabrication cost must be optimized to allow fuel cells to penetrate the commercial market and compete with other energy sources. The bipolar plates perform as the current conductors between cells, provide conduits for reactant gases flow, and constitute the backbone of a power stack. They are commonly made of graphite composite for high corrosion resistance and good surface contact resistance; however their manufacturability, permeability, and durability for shock and vibration are unfavorable in comparison to metals. On the other hand, various methods and techniques must be developed to combat metallic corrosion and eliminate the passive layer that causes unacceptable reduction in contact resistance and possible fouling of the catalyst and the ionomer. Thus recently metallic bipolar plates have received considerable attention in the research community. This paper offers a comprehensive review of the research work conducted on metal bipolar plates to prevent corrosion while maintaining a low contact resistance. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

This paper presents results of proton exchange membrane (PEM) single-cell fuel cell studies of stamped and pre-oxidized/nitrided developmental Fe-20Cr-4V weight percent (wt.\%) and commercial type 2205 stainless steel alloy foils. The single-cell fuel cell behavior of the stamped and pre-oxidized/nitrided material was compared to as-stamped (no surface treatment) 904L, 2205, and Fe-20Cr-4V stainless steel alloy foils and machined graphite of similar flow field design. The best fuel cell behavior among the alloys was exhibited by the pre-oxidized/nitrided Fe-20Cr-4V, which exhibited {$\sim$}5-20\% better peak power output than untreated Fe-20Cr-4V, 2205, and 904L metal stampings. Durability was assessed for pre-oxidized/nitrided Fe-20Cr-4V, 904L metal, and graphite plates by 1000+ h of cyclic single-cell fuel cell testing. All three materials showed good durability with no significant degradation in cell power output. Post-test analysis indicated no metal ion contamination of the membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) occurred with the pre-oxidized and nitrided Fe-20Cr-4V or graphite plates, and only a minor amount of contamination with the 904L plates. \copyright{} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

Application of similar nitridation parameters to an austenitic stainless steel, 349â„¢, however, resulted in a discontinuous mixture of discrete CrN, Cr2N and (Cr,Fe)2N1-x (x = 0-0.5) phase surface particles overlying an exposed {$\gamma$} austenite-based matrix, rather than a continuous nitride surface layer. The interfacial contact resistance of the 349â„¢ was reduced significantly by the nitridation treatment. However, in the simulated PEMFC environments (1 M H2 SO4 + 2 ppm F- solutions at 70{$^\circ$}C sparged with either hydrogen or air), very high corrosion currents were observed under both anodic and cathodic conditions. This poor behavior was linked to the lack of continuity of the Cr-rich nitride surface formed on 349â„¢.

The layer was not continuous, and although it resulted in low interfacial contact resistance (ICR) and good corrosion resistance under simulated polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) cathodic conditions; poor corrosion resistance was observed under simulated anodic conditions. Nitridation for 2 h at 1100{$^\circ$}C resulted in little nitrogen uptake and a tinted surface. Analysis by SEM, XPS, and AES suggested a complex heterogeneous modification of the native passive oxide film by nitrogen rather than the desired microns-thick exclusive Cr-rich nitride layer. Surprisingly, this modification resulted in both good corrosion resistance under simulated cathodic and anodic conditions and low ICR, well over an order of magnitude lower than the untreated alloy. Further, little increase in ICR was observed under passivating polarization conditions. The potential of this phenomenon for PEMFC bipolar plates is discussed. {$^\circ$} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract     = {Polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells, which convert the chemical energy stored in hydrogen fuel directly and efficiently to electrical energy with water as the only byproduct, have the potential to reduce our energy use, pollutant emissions, and dependence on fossil fuels. Great deal of efforts has been made in the past, particularly during the last couple of decades or so, to advance the PEM fuel cell technology and fundamental research. Factors such as durability and cost still remain as the major barriers to fuel cell commercialization. In the past two years, more than 35\% cost reduction has been achieved in fuel cell fabrication, the current status of \$61/kW (2009) for transportation fuel cell is still over 50\% higher than the target of the US Department of Energy (DOE), i.e. \$30/kW by 2015, in order to compete with the conventional technology of internal-combustion engines. In addition, a lifetime of ???2500. h (for transportation PEM fuel cells) was achieved in 2009, yet still needs to be doubled to meet the DOE's target, i.e. 5000. h. Breakthroughs are urgently needed to overcome these barriers. In this regard, fundamental studies play an important and indeed critical role. Issues such as water and heat management, and new material development remain the focus of fuel-cell performance improvement and cost reduction. Previous reviews mostly focus on one aspect, either a specific fuel cell application or a particular area of fuel cell research. The objective of this review is three folds: (1) to present the latest status of PEM fuel cell technology development and applications in the transportation, stationary, and portable/micro power generation sectors through an overview of the state-of-the-art and most recent technical progress; (2) to describe the need for fundamental research in this field and fill the gap of addressing the role of fundamental research in fuel cell technology; and (3) to outline major challenges in fuel cell technology development and the needs for fundamental research for the near future and prior to fuel cell commercialization. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The as-prepared niobium nitride diffusion coating consists of a niobium nitride surface layer (8-9 ??m) and a Nb and N diffusion solid solution subsurface layer (1-2 ??m). The corrosion resistance of the niobium nitride modified 304 SS are investigated and evaluated in simulated PEFMC operating conditions (0.05 M H2SO4 + 2 ppm F- solution at 70 ??C). Results show that the niobium nitride diffusion coating greatly improves the corrosion resistance of 304 SS. Self-corrosion potentials of niobium nitride modified 304 SS increase considerably up to 100 mV and 143 mV (vs. SCE) while corrosion current densities remain low at 0.127 ??A cm -2 and 0.071 ??A cm-2 in simulated anodic and cathodic environment, respectively. Interfacial contact resistance (ICR) of niobium nitride modified 304 SS is 9.26 m?? cm2 under 140 N cm -2 compaction force, which is much lower than that of untreated 304 SS, 100.98 m?? cm2.
