  abstract   = {We report the 2022 self-consistent values of constants and conversion factors of physics and chemistry recommended by the Committee on Data of the International Science Council (CODATA). The recommended values can also be found at physics.nist.gov/constants. The values are based on a least-squares adjustment that takes into account all theoretical and experimental data available through 31 December 2022. A discussion of the major improvements as well as inconsistencies within the data is given.},
